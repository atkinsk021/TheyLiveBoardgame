THEY LIVE: The Unofficial Board Game
Board game / Card game
Target age: 12+

GAME SUMMARY: 
THEY LIVE takes place in the late 1980’s. Aliens have invaded and Hypnotised the entire population! The players find themselves in possession of SUPER SHADES, the only tool that shows the world in its true form, an alien conglomerate. Players must work together across three phases to fight back and fund the resistance to lead a hostile takeover! Be warned, too much exposure to hypnotisation may cause to turn heel and join the Aliens. Once funds are completed, the humans must race to the designated spot to destroy the Alien radar dish and free humanity from hypnotisation!

GAME OUTLINE: 
As a Human, the player must traverse the map collecting cash to help fund the resistance against the Aliens.
As an Alien, the player must stop the Humans from reaching their fund goal by strategically placing Hypno cards around the map while reducing their income.
All players start in Phase 1 as Humans with the goal of gaining as much cash as possible. Players must avoid the pre-placed Hypno cards if possible while moving around through map. Once a player is hit too many times by Hypno cards, they switch sides and become an alien.
Phase 2 begins at this point. Aliens must buy Hypno cards to stop the Humans from gaining more funds. Humans must do everything they can to continue gaining funds and fighting off the Alien threat.
Phase 3 begins once the Humans have hit their cash goal. The alien must decide it’s Headquarters at the beginning of this phase. Once selected, the Humans must make their way to the Headquarters to win the game. This will prove difficult as the Alien now has a much easier chance to stop the Humans.
Aliens can win at any time by winning fight against the Humans or by depleting the Human resistance funds.
